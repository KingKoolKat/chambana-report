As a young kid, I was frightened by severe weather. But I am accustomed to tornado sirens and the basement flooding as common Midwestern occurrences. Something about the strength of a storm still thrills me though as I’ve gotten a bit older (and more levelheaded). So I used the pattern of a map showing wind speed and direction, overlaid with scans of fall leaves I collected. We’re in a time of change, something in itself a bit frightening, but I believe the leaves could be representative of. So as I sit here in Urbana, watching trees change a bit, I wonder about the lack of a thrilling storm the past few weeks. Nothing could scare me or hype me up any more.
