I remember the first time I ever saw them. Scrolling through my Instagram feed, I discovered a few virtual animals that would change my life.  

Their name was Momo and Sasa’s Pet Universe, and I found them to be a wealth of creativity. Momo and Sasa would go on adventures across the universe, visiting places such as Candy Planet or Sasa’s mind pavilion.  

Their adventures were fascinating; in the first video I ever saw, a dog father built a candy fan to help his son. This Instagram reel nearly brought me to tears. I sat back and enjoyed this new world each day, reel by reel.

Then one day, something changed. There was a shift, a change in the universe.  

Momo and Sasa’s episodic nature was replaced with food reviews and the pets wishing their fans a happy birthday. The writing was on the wall: Momo and Sasa had sold out.

The Momo and Sasa that I’d fallen in love with were never truly the same. Despite my four Instagram DMs over the past few months, Momo and Sasa have gone radio silent.
