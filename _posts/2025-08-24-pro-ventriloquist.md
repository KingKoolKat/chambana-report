It’s easy to get wrapped up in the mysticism and otherworldliness of ventriloquism, but don’t let that distract you from the real professionals behind the craft. Instead of falling for the common misconception that the dummy is a real creature that has come to life, take a moment to recognize the industry professionals who have spent years honing their skills.

Ventriloquists spend hundreds, if not thousands, of hours practicing the art of throwing their voice. Ventriloquism is a field that not only requires countless hours of practice but also demands that professionals take a gamble on their health and well-being. Every time a ventriloquist performs, they risk straining their vocal cords or getting their fingers pinched in the nightmarish controls of the dummy. Many have even suffered an early end to their careers after a dummy-related incident.

It’s not as if ventriloquists are at the top of the totem pole when it comes to the magician industry. They aren’t selling out stadiums, nor do they get a chance to freeze themselves in a block of ice with David Blaine. Instead, ventriloquists are more like the second cousins of the magician industry—you feel like you don’t really know them, but they *are* family!

At the end of the day, a ventriloquist is a master of their craft—an artist so skilled they can make even someone as reasonable as you or I believe, for a moment, in the existence of magic. All I ask is that next time you’re in awe of a hilarious dummy, remind yourself of who’s really pulling the strings.
