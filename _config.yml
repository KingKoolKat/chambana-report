      bio:            "Jon is the editor in chief and technical director of the Chambana Report. He only knows one magic trick (and it is a relatively basic one) but he used to know 2 or 3 other tricks. He has a seasonal interest in snails and dreams to name the shiftiest one \"Snail Gilgeous Alexander\"."
