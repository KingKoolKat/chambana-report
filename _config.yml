He enjoys playing a game called Guess My Ethnicity but gets frustrated when it goes on for too long and the person playing starts naming obscure European countries. He has a seasonal interest in snails and dreams to name one Snail Gilgeous Alexander"

      bio:            "David is our creative director and spearheads a good deal of our investigative work. When he's not watching Ryan play Overwatch on his PS5, he can be found intently reading the words on other people's graphic tees. He has never watched the Piece by Piece Lego Movie but really wants to."
